# DSI Instructor Task: Part 1

## Background
In this challenge, we are looking to assess your Python coding ability and data science skills. We'll be working on [the following dataset, which includes measurements of breast cancer cells](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/b5c536467c30d66ab97cd1f5c9a3497d). The task is to predict for each cell, whether is it *malignant* or *benign*. Please follow the guidelines below.

> Note: Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Part 1: Modeling Challenge

#### Python Coding and Data Set
- Load in the data file and header file provided
    - The dataframe does not currently have a header, load in the header file and attach it to the dataframe
- Comment on any steps you might take to evaluate or transform the dataset.
- Compute the mean and median smoothness and compactness for benign and malignant tumors - do they differ? Explain how you would identify this.
- Write a function to generate bootstrap samples of the data.

#### Exploratory Analysis
- Identify 2-3 variables that are predictive of a malignant tumor.
    - Display the relationship visually and write 1-2 sentences explaining the relationship.

#### Modeling
- Build a model to predict the malignant tumors.
    - Use at least two classification techniques; compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    - Identify how you would control for overfitting in each classification technique.
    - Evaluate the performance of each model.
    - In each model, identify the most important predictive variables and explain how you identified them.

#### Explanation
- To Technical Audiences
    - Explain the limitations of your analysis and identify possible further steps you could take.
- To Non-Technical Audiences
    - Write a short summary of your analysis, explaining how your model works and how it performs.
    - Briefly explain the factors that contributed to malignant vs benign tumor identification.
